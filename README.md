# London-Bike-Rides
In this project we take a look at bike rides taken in the city of London between 2015 and 2017. Istart by extracting the data programmatically through Pandas, via the Kaggle API. I then transform and prepare the data, and write out the final Excel file to be loaded into Tableau for visualization.

The repository contains four files:
1. The finished product (Tableau workbook).
2. The Jupyter Notebooks file with all the code used for extracting and transforming the data.
3. The original CSV file (london-merged)
4. The Excel file with the data used in Tableau (london_bikes_final)
